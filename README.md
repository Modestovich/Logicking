<h2>Task</h2>
Make an application "approximation of tabular given
functions" on Android.
Android version is not
higher than 4.2.
<h2>Description</h2>
The user can define multiple points on the chart with a rectangular
coordinate system (thereby defining table variables of a function).
<br/>
The user specifies the value of the table function at x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
<br/>
Change points (y) by touching the screen.
Then this function should be approximated and should be drawen the result using :
<br/>
a) the method of least squares polynomial of third degree.
<br/>
b) Lagrange polynomial.
<br/>
It is possible to make one of two methods, or both.
<br/>
Additionally extrapolated values of the function at x = 0 and x = 6.
<br/>
Reset button clears
schedule and allows the user to re-set point.
<br/>
Non-scalable / non-scrollable.
<br/>
The scale of the graph is static.
